	<a1>Badminton is a sport in which light rackets are used to volley an object—called a shuttlecock, 
	shuttle, birdie, or bird—back and forth over a high net. Unlike other similar sports, such as tennis,
	badminton is not played with a ball—the shuttlecock is a kind of feathered cone with a cork head.<a1><br>
