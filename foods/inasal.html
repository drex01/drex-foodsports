	<a1>Chicken Inasal is a grilled chicken dish and one of the well known Ilonggo dishes. 
		This is done by marinating chicken pieces in a unique blend of spices and grilling them until done. 
		Sounds like a simple grilled chicken recipe, isnâ€™t it? Well, it might sound like one; 
		however, the special marinade and basting sauce makes this Ilonggo version of the grilled chicken extra special.<a1><br>
