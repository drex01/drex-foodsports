	<h1>LECHON</h1>

	<a1>An indispensable delicacy in the Philippine celebrations, lechon — also known as lechon baboy — 
		is a dish in which the entire pig or piglet is stuffed, glazed, and slowly spit-roasted over coals. 
		The most coveted part is the crispy, golden brown skin, which tops the tender meat that melts in one’s mouth. 
		The preparation of lechon is lengthy, but the Filipinos see it as an excellent opportunity to socialize. 
		Traditionally, the pig or piglet is slaughtered early in the morning, its entrails are removed, and 
		boiling water is poured over the skin so the hair can be scraped off. Next, salt and pepper are rubbed 
		on the inside and the outside, and the pig is skewered on a long bamboo pole. The inside of the pig is 
		stuffed with various ingredients, which can include lemongrass, garlic, onion, bay leaves, tamarind leaves, 
		saba bananas, and star anise, and is then sewn together with twine. The pig is slowly roasted over coals
		while being turned and constantly glazed with either evaporated milk, soy sauce, oil, or even soft drinks 
		such as Sprite and 7up. After a few hours, the whole pig is ceremonially brought to the festive table and 
		chopped into portions.<a1><br>
